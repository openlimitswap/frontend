## Open LimitSwap

Open LimitSwap consists in a fork of the [LimitSwap](https://github.com/CryptoGnome/LimitSwap) and [LimitSniper](https://github.com/CryptoGnome/Limit-Sniper) trading bots projects developed by CryptoGnome. According to the [official wiki](https://cryptognome.gitbook.io/limitswap/), they help traders by:

* Snipe new tokens at listing
* Place Limit Orders 
* Create fully automated strategies

This is a community effort of a group of developers who are major fans of **LimitSwap** and who wish to build upon the open source version of these two bots, by adding new features and make some changes to the existing bots. In particular, we have completely removed any license requirement in order to use the bots.

### Highlights

✔️ 100% free to use, forever

✔️ Hassle free migration by supporting existing LimitSwap and LimitSniper configurations

✔️ Not required to hold $LIMIT or any other token

✔️ Same community from existing LimitSwap Telegram group

✔️ Single binary releases for Windows, MacOS X and Linux

✔️ Community driven governance

### Motivation

Like stated earlier, LimitSwap and LimitSniper and two great projects which we love. However we feel that the licensing model is completely inadequate, in particular it requires you to hold over 4000$ USD (at the time of writing) in $LIMIT token in order to use the Sniper bot. This is a major turndown to many aspiring users, so we decided to remove this requirement and make the bots 100% free to use. 

⚠️ We still recommend that you support LimitSwap by holding an amount of $LIMIT tokens which you are able to afford. The team deserves it.
